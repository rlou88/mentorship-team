# Node.js Mentorship Program

I studied JavaScript and Node.js during bootcamp and fell in love with it! It is my go to and most comfortable back end programming language to build my projects! It would be a monumental accomplishment to contribute and mentored by Node.js. I love the opportunity to be apart of the team and help spread the influence of Node.js to all JS developers!

I always valued open source platforms and it would be a tremendous impact in my junior developer career! Being a part of a team with weekly team meetings, collaborating with mentors and mentees will build my soft skills. Handling routine repo maintenance and responding to issues will advance my knowledge and skills on GitHub.
